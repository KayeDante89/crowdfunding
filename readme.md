### About Love Ledger

Love Ledger is a unique crowdfunding app that helps couples raise funds for their dream wedding. Planning a wedding can be expensive, and many couples struggle to cover the costs on their own. Love Ledger provides a platform for couples to create a crowdfunding campaign and share it with their family and friends, who can contribute towards the cost of the wedding.

## Features

Features that still needs working on:

- [ ] Filter/Search bar
- [ ] Edit/Delete function
- [ ] Somehow signed out people can still pledge if they tick anonymous? Not good.
